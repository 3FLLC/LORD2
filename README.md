LORD2
=====

An open source version of Legend Of the Red Dragon II.  Just compile and drop LORD2.EXE in the same directory as your LORD2 installation and enjoy!  (That's the plan anyway -- will be awhile before that's a reality)

Legend Of the Red Dragon II is owned by Metropolis GamePort, which I have no affiliation with.

The code in this repository has been written from scratch -- no LORD2 source code (neither original Pascal source, nor decompiled Assembly source) has been referenced in its implementation.
