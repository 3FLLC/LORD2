This example program is known to compile in the following configurations:


DOS
        Borland Pascal v7.0

Win32
	Delphi v6.0
        FreePascal v2.0.0 (v2.0.2 was tested and did NOT work)
	Virtual Pascal v2.1 build 279

FreeBSD, Linux and OS/2 should work, but they are no longer officially
supported since they are a pain in the ass to test.  So if something
I did broke these platforms, feel free to submit a patch, I won't be
able to catch errors with them myself.

*NOTE* - To compile using Delphi you should rename mastrmnd.pas to mastrmnd.dpr
