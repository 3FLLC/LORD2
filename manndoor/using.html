          <h3>Documentation (Or Lack Thereof)</h3>
          <blockquote>
            I'm not a big fan of writing documentation, so unfortunately MannDoor doesn't
            come with any.  Fortunately MannDoor comes in source form, so if you want to
            see what functions/procedures a particular unit has, you just have to open it
            in a text editor and take a look.  Each function/procedure is commented at the
            top so you should be able to see what it does fairly easily.<br />
            <br />
            Basically every function/procedure you would find in the CRT unit has been
            included in MannDoor, just prefixed with "m".  So for example, if you are used
            to using KeyPressed, ReadKey and ClrScr, MannDoor implements these as mKeyPressed,
            mReadKey and mClrScr.  Of course there are a lot of others as well, so make sure
            you go take a look.<br />
            <br />
            If you still have trouble, your best bet is to look at MASTRMND.PAS in the EXAMPLE
            subdirectory.  I tried to make it do all the things that may be somewhat confusing,
            so it should be a good reference on how things work.

          <h3>About This Document</h3>
          <blockquote>
            At one time, MannDoor officially supported 4 different compilers running on 5 different
            operating systems (8 variations in total).  I don't have the time and inclination
            to officially support so many combinations anymore now though, so I'm only
            officially supporting (and by that I mean testing before releasing) DOS programs
            written with Borland/Turbo Pascal 7, and Win32 programs written with Delphi 6,
            Virtual Pascal 2.1b279, or FreePascal 2.0.0.  That doesn't mean I've removed support
            for Linux, FreeBSD or OS/2, just that I won't be testing them before releasing
            a new version of MannDoor.  This means something I did, or something a new version
            of one of the supported compilers did, may break those 3 platforms.<br />
            <br />
            Please note this list is of compilers and OS's that I personally tested
            with at one time.  If your favourite compiler/OS is not listed here, that does not mean
            it is incompatable, it just means I personally don't have the resources to
            test it.  If you want something added to the list, send me the steps you had
            to take for your compiler/OS, and I'll add it.<br />

          <h3>Setup For All Systems</h3>
          <blockquote>
            No matter which compiler/OS you are using, you will have to add the
            UNITS and UNITS\ELECOM directories into the "Unit Directories Search Path".<br />
            <br />
            In Borland Pascal/Virtual Pascal that means opening the IDE and pressing
            ALT-O and then D to open the Directories dialog.  Then you enter the paths
            into the "Unit directories" box.<br />
            <br />
            In FreePascal that means adding -Fu lines to your FPC.CFG file.  I don't use
            the FreePascal IDE, but I would imagine the steps are the same as for BP/VP.<br />
            <br />
            In Delphi that means opening the IDE and pressing ALT-P and then O to open
            the Project Options dialog.  Switch to the Directories/Conditionals tab and
            then you enter the paths into the "Search Path" box.<br />

          <h3>Setup For DOS Systems</h3>
          <blockquote>
            In addition to the UNITS and UNITS\ELECOM directories, DOS compilers will also
            have to add the UNITS\DOS directory using the same method described above.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Borland Pascal 7.0</b>
            <ol>
              <li>BP\SYSUTILS.PAS must be copied somewhere that only BP will have 
                  access to it (ie \BP\UNITS)</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Free Pascal 1.9.6</b>
            <ol>            
              <li>Try to be TP/BP 7.0 compatable (-So option)</li>
              <li>NOTE: Free Pascal 2.0.0 was never officially released for DOS, and
                  version 2.0.2 does not work with MannDoor.  Using Free Pascal to
                  compile DOS targets is discouraged.</li>
            </ol>

          <blockquote>
            In addition to the UNITS and UNITS\ELECOM directories, FreeBSD compilers will also
            have to add the UNITS\UNIX directory using the same method described above.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Free Pascal 2.0.2</b>
            <ol>

          <h3>Setup For OS/2 System</h3>
          <blockquote>
            In addition to the UNITS and UNITS\ELECOM directories, OS/2 compilers will also
            have to add the UNITS\OS2 directory using the same method described above.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Virtual Pascal 2.1 Build 279</b>
            <ol>

              <li>Include Use32 unit must be enabled (Press Alt-O then C)</li>

          <h3>Setup For Win32 System</h3>
          <blockquote>
            In addition to the UNITS and UNITS\ELECOM directories, Win32 compilers will also
            have to add the UNITS\WIN32 directory using the same method described above.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Borland Delphi 6.0</b>
            <ol>                     
              <li>Assignable typed constants must be enabled (Press Alt-P then O, Compiler tab)</li>
              <li>Generate console application must be enabled (Press Alt-P then O, Linker tab)</li>
              <li>DELPHI\CRT.PAS and DELPHI\DOS.PAS must be copied somewhere that only Delphi will
                  have access to them</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Free Pascal 2.0.0</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Try to be Delphi compatable (-Sd option)</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Virtual Pascal 2.1 Build 279</b>

                  These files can only be used with VP2.1 b279, they probably will not
                  work with any older or newer version
